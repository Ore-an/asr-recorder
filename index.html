    <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p> You will need to record ten utterances using only words taken from the tongue-twister passage: "Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. Where's the peck of pickled peppers Peter piper picked".  Recordings will be shared with all your classmates to enable everyone to work with read speech data in your labs and assignments.</p>

   ASR experiments will be more meaningful if you:
   <ul>
      <li>vary your ten utterances both in terms of the words you read, and in the length of the utterances</li>
      <li>don't simply read single isolated words (unless you struggle a lot with the vocabulary!)</li>
      <li>read as fluently as you can, avoiding pauses between words as much as possible (pauses at the beginning and end of each recording are fine)</li>
   </ul>
    <p>Don't worry about poor pronunciations (that's part of the challenge of ASR), but if you accidentally say a word that is not in the vocabulary above, it is better to discard that utterance.</p>

      <p>Feel free to create a script in advance of reading, or just do it on the fly.</p>

      <p>After making the recording of each utterance, you will need to enter a transcription of what you read.  It goes without saying that you should do your best to make sure that your transcription is accurate!</p>

      <li>Enter your UNN</li>
      <li>Record your ten utterances as <b>separate recordings</b>. Use the buttons to start and stop the recording - there will be a pulsing red dot when recoding is in progress.</li>
      <li>After each recording, you can replay it if you like.  If you are happy, enter the transcription, and click 'upload'</li>
